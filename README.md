# UAV Strategic Deconfliction in Shared Airspace ✈️

This repository contains the implementation of a **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) strategic deconfliction framework** designed to ensure safe and efficient multi-drone operations within shared airspace. The system focuses on detecting potential conflicts and generating safe, optimized flight paths before UAVs execute their missions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the increasing presence of UAVs in civilian and defense operations, airspace congestion and UAV-to-UAV collisions are major risks.  
This project proposes a **strategic (pre-flight) deconfliction system**, ensuring UAV flight paths are validated, conflict-free, and optimized prior to deployment.

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🔍 **Conflict Detection:** Identifies potential path intersections between UAVs.
- 🧭 **Trajectory Optimization:** Adjusts UAV routes using intelligent planning approaches.
- 🤖 **Algorithmic Flexibility:** Allows plug-and-play use of multiple path planning strategies.
- 🛰️ **Scalable Architecture:** Supports multiple UAVs simultaneously.
- 📊 **Visualization Support (Future):** Map-based flight path plotting and conflict visualization.
